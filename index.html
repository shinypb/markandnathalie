            <h4>Accommodations</h4>
<p>Where you will want to stay depends entirely on what you will want to do while you're here (besides attend our wedding), how long you're planning on staying, how much you want to pay&hellip;and whether you prefer convenience, comfort, or a place where you can host a whole cohort.</p>

<h5>The official hotel</h5>
<p>If you're just in town for the wedding, we've secured a block of hotel rooms for Friday (October 11) and Saturday night (October 12) at the Hilton in San Mateo. Our group rate is $105/night for a single king-sized bed and $125/night for two double beds. To reserve a room, call <a href="tel://18777829444">1-877-STAY-HGI</a> and <strong>ask for the group rate for Ms. Nathalie Arch</strong>.

<h5>Staying longer?</h5>
<p>The <em>All-around Great Option Award</em> goes to <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>, offering vacation rentals, private rooms, and whole houses for rental by owner.</p>

<p>You can also use <a href="https://www.google.com/hotelfinder/">Google Hotel Finder</a> to list hotels by city, price range, and date range.</p>

<p>There are no standard-fare lodgings in Woodside. You will have to stay in one of the surrounding towns &mdash; we suggest staying in San Mateo (where we live) if possible.</p>

<div id="map-container"><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=208877403558933266515.0004d465a911c8bb918cc&msa=0&ll=37.625109,-122.295685&spn=1.341083,1.18515"><img src="img/map.png" id="map" height="400" width="366"></a></div>

<p>When booking your trip, you may want to consider the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The wedding venue is not accessible by public transit or even the most avid hiker. While we are investigating shuttles and other options, we highly recommend you plan to rent a car while you're here. (Fun options for renting a car for short or long stays include <a href="http://zipcar.com">Zipcar</a>, and there are the usual places like <a href="http://hertz.com">Hertz</a>.)</li>

<li>We do not recommend trying to hire a cab or taxi to the venue; it will probably cost a fortune. Even if you do want to take a cab to the venue, it will be difficult to call a cab to take you back to your lodgings. Please plan in advance! Limo services are a fancy option that will probably compare in price to hiring a cab.</li>

            <h4>FAQ</h4>
            <p>Mark and Nathalie have had a lot of questions about other peoples’ weddings that range from reasonable (&ldquo;What is a lounge suit?&rdquo;) to a little boneheaded (&ldquo;Are there hats?&rdquo;). It is therefore with great attention to the curious and confused out there that we overburden you with facts, suggestions, and tips about our wedding to ensure that you feel welcome, comfortable, and unstressed.</p>

            <h5>How do I get to the venue(s)?</h5>
            <p>Check out the <a href="#venue">Venue + Directions</a> page for directions from San Francisco, Halifax, San Jose, and Santa Cruz.</p>

            <h5>Is there a shuttle to take me there?</h5
            <p>Yes; we're still finalizing this part. Stay tuned for details.</p>

            <h5>What time should I arrive?</h5>
            <p>The ceremony begins at 4:30 PM. Please plan to be seated by that point.</p>

            <h5>Where should I park?</h5>
            <p>There is parking in front of the Mountain Terrace.</p>

            <h5>Will I have to pay for parking?</h5>
            <p>Nope.</p>

            <h5>What should I wear?</h5>
            <p>The recommended dress code is &ldquo;dressy cocktail.&rdquo; Dinner jackets, ties, and bowties are encouraged. A tux would be a step too far in one direction; jeans would be a step too far in the other direction. Dresses and skirts don’t need to be floor-length.</p>

            <p>It is <strong>ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL</strong> that you dress for the weather, and in layers! The ceremony is set to take place in an open area with no shade. October can be unpredictable in California, especially at a higher altitude. It may be sunny and warm (so you should bring sunscreen), but it also may end up being chilly (so you should wear layers). Please, please, please dress sensibly for a comfortable evening.</p>

            <h5>What kind of shoes should/shouldn't I wear?</h5>
            <p>The venue features a big grassy lawn, which you will almost certainly have to walk on. Fancy, spiky heels and suede boots are not good friends with nature.</p>

            <h5>Are there any colo(u)rs that guests should avoid wearing?</h5>
            <p>The wedding party will be dressed in purples and greys/grays, although that doesn’t mean you should avoid these colo(u)rs.</p>

            <h5>Are kids welcome?</h5>
            <p>Please let us know ahead of time if you plan on bringing your kids along with you. Alternatively, we can recommend some awesome babysitters.</p>

            <h5>Can I bring a date?</h5>
            <p>Due to space limitations, we regret that we are having no +1s.</p>

            <h5>Does your wedding have a theme?</h5>
            <p>Whimsicalifornia, and wisteria.</p>

            <h5>I am coming from out of town. Where should I stay?</h5>
            <p>Please see the <a href="#accommodations">Accommodations</a> page.</p>

            <h5>When is the RSVP deadline?</h5>
            <p>TBD; check your invitation when it arrives.</p>

            <h5>Are the ceremony and reception locations wheelchair accessible?</h5>
            <p>Yes. You’ll have the best time if you let us know your needs in advance.</p>

            <h5>What is a &ldquo;non-religious&rdquo; ceremony like?</h5>
            <p>Neither Nathalie nor Mark are religious, or spiritual. The reception will therefore focus on the exchange of vows, and the signing of a marriage license (per Canadian tradition!).</p>

            <h5>What should/could I do between the ceremony and the reception?</h5>
            <p>Weather permitting, there will be passed appetizers and drinks on the lawn, as well as a variety of lawn games like croquet, bocce ball, and cornhole. Handstands and cartwheels are welcome!</p>

            <h5>Will food be served?</h5>
            <p>Yes, but we haven't finalized our menu yet. We plan on serving fish, chicken, and vegetarian options.</p>

            <h5>What if I have a dietary restriction?</h5>
            <p>Please inform Nathalie and Mark of your dietary needs in advance to ensure we scout out the best and yummiest food for you. Vegans, vegetarians, and gluten-free folks will be in attendance, so don’t hesitate to drop us a line about what you want to eat. We are dedicated to ensuring your dietary needs are met, and then exceeded! :)</p>

            <h5>Will there be dancing?</h5>
            <p>Of course!</p>

            <h5>Will there be any activities happening that I need to know about?</h5>
            <p>Nope. </p>

            <h5>What time will the reception end?</h5>
            <p>The venue is booked until 11 pm, but we might go into overtime.</p>

            <h5>Is there a gifts registry?</h5>
            <p>Yessum; please see the <a href="#registry">Registry + Honeymoon</a> page.</p>

            <h5>Will last names be changing after the wedding?</h5>
            <p>Yes. Nathalie will take Mark’s last name.</p>

            <h5>Does your wedding have a hashtag?</h5>
            <p>Of course &mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23markalie">#markalie</a>.
